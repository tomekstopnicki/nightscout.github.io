Once setup, Nightscout acts as a central repository of blood glucose and insulin dosing/treatment data for a single person, allowing you to view the CGM graph and treatment data anywhere using just a web browser connected to the internet. There are several parts to this system. You need somewhere online to store/process/visualise this data ( a Nightscout Site ), something to upload CGM data to your Nightscout ( a Master/Uploader ), and then optionally you can use other devices to access/view this data ( a Follower or usually several ): Nightscout Site \u2301 The Nightscout cloud application can be installed by yourself using free hosting services from various cloud service providers. Although not necessary, you might prefer to use paid hosting services for your database (to avoid future maintenance tasks) or indeed pay to use a fully-managed Nightscout hosting service to avoid having to personally build and maintain your site yourself. Master/Uploader \u2301 The CGM data is usually sent to Nightscout by an uploader device (often known as a \"Master\" ) such as a mobile/cellphone running an app such as xDrip+, Spike, xDrip4iOS or Medtronic Uploader. Alternatively, the CGM data can be pulled directly from your online Dexcom or Medtronic CareLink accounts. The application you'll need for uploading the data depends on which CGM device you're using and what type of mobile device you have. Once you've read this page (yes - all the way to the bottom!), you can find more information here about Uploaders . Followers \u2301 In addition to viewing the data using a web browser, there are also applications available for mobile devices, smartwatches, electronic devices and other cloud-based services which allow you alternative ways to view and interact with the information stored within your Nightscout site (often known as \"Followers\" ). Development History \u2301 Nightscout was developed by parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes and has continued to be developed, maintained, and supported by volunteers. When first implemented, Nightscout was a solution specifically for remote monitoring of Dexcom G4 CGM data. Today, there are Nightscout solutions available for nearly all commercial CGM sensors. The goal of the project is to allow the remote monitoring, sharing and analysis of any T1D's glucose levels using existing monitoring devices. What Do I Need? \u2301 You really don't need too much to get Nightscout up and running but let's start with the basics. Are you sitting comfortably? Then let's begin. You will need: A CGM sensor: Dexcom, Medtronic, Libre (plus an additional transmitter) or Eversense A way to upload your data (this is generally an internet-connected mobile phone with a matching uploader app) Internet access 1 hour of \"quiet\" time (a beer nice cup of coffee is optional but highly recommended) Basic computer skills and the ability to carefully follow the installation guides shown on this site \"Carefully\" means that you will thoroughly read, follow and complete each step without skipping any and without giving up thinking that it is too difficult - it isn't, you just need to be patient. IMPORTANT Before using Nightscout, it is important to understand that this project: is an open-source, community-based project and is not supported by any company is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way You must understand that you take full responsibility for building and running this system and you agree to do so at your own risk. SAFETY This project requires a working internet connection and availability of third-party cloud services Do not rely only on Nightscout as the only way you have of knowing your blood glucose values and trends Make sure you're ready to cope with an unexpected failure and always have alternative ways to check your blood glucose levels How Much Does It Cost? \u2301 Nightscout has essentially always been a completely free sevice to install and use. The installation instructions take advantage of free accounts from cloud service providers to install and run the application. In late 2020 some of these services changed slightly and this caused some extra work to make them suitable for running Nightscout. It is still perfectly feasible to build your Nightscout site and operate it entirely for free , you just need to be aware that you might experience some limitations which are easily managed using the tools available within the Nightscout \"Admin Tools\" page. Free databases like the Altas M0 Sandbox provided by MongoDB will hold a limited amount of data (512MB) and you may eventually need to delete old records (maybe every 3-4 years with standard Nightscout CGM useage). You can increase even further the database capacity to 2GB/5GB by paying for an M2/M5 Shared Cluster if you wish. Application servers such as Heroku 's \"Free\" plan will provide enough server hours to run a single Nightscout site without any downtime. If you need to run several sites on the same account, you can easily upgrade to a paid \"Hobby\" plan. Finally, if you prefer to avoid any manual set-up, configuration and maintenance tasks, then you can also opt for a paid and fully-managed Nightscout hosting service. Who Can Help Me? \u2301 You will find many willing and open-hearted people in the Facebook groups. The main group for all Nightscout support is the \" CGM in the Cloud \" Facebook group. There are also many local Nightscout communities and you'll probably be able to find one in your own country and language if this helps. Technical Support This project is often considered \" Do It Yourself \" (DIY) and supported by volunteers. Whilst you will almost certainly always will find someone ready to help you for free, building your own Nightscout site doesn't entitle you to any form of support from anybody. The open-source diabetes movement is founded on the idea of paying it forward and helping others to learn things that others took their time to help teach you about. Ask nicely, and nice people will always do nice things and help you. Nightscout developers are busy people and we'd like them to concentrate on maintaining and improving Nightscout, not only supporting users. (This means do not send them private messages or friend requests just to help fix something that is already clearly documented or for help that can be easily requested in the CGM in the Cloud group) Facebook Privacy You'll find a lot of useful and friendly diabetes-oriented groups on Facebook and it's probably the best place to find online support. Some people express concerns about using Facebook: if you're worried about your privacy just remember Facebook will only share the information that you allow it to share. Paid Solutions \u2301 If you prefer to pay and just use Nightscout as a fully managed service and let somebody else worry about installation and maintenance then T1Pal could be exactly what you need. The T1Pal hosting service has been developed by Ben West , a member of the original CGM in the Cloud team and an original lead core developer for the Nightscout Project.

It it strongly recommended that you secure your site. It should look very similar to this when your uploader has added some data. The central part will show your recent BG, you can select how many hours you want to be displayed with Hours: 2 3 4 6 12 24 . The pale blue dots are the AR2 prevision as explained here . The lower part will display the last 48 hours and you can use the lower right selection to browse your old data. In the upper part you'll see the current time of your site, your current BG (and how long ago it was measured) plus the delta with the previous measurement and a trend arrow. More explanations here . Optionally you will see other indications (pills) that can be personalized in your variables and plugins like detailed here . Authenticate yourself \u2301 By default you site opens read only, you need to authenticate using your API secret in order to modify settings and add treatments. Click on the lock icon, enter your API secret and click Update . This will unlock your careportal ( if enabled ) and edit ( if enabled ). Add a treatment ( careportal ) \u2301 Some uploaders will send treatments to Nightscout but others won't. If you whish to do this manually, careportal is here for that. + will open an interface to manually enter treatments. In the Event Type drop down menu, you can select the treatment type you want to add. Additional available entries will depend on the plugins you enabled like Loop and OpenAPS/AAPS. BG Check \u2301 BG check allows you to enter a blood glucose reading value from your Meter . With a CGM using Sensor reading doesn't add much value. Keep in mind the value will be inserted now (unless you modify the event time) and might not match your CGM value for non stable BG due to capillary time lag. Correction Bolus \u2301 Correction Bolus allows you to enter the amount of insulin units injected for a correction. It will show as a circle with the lower half blue, with its size depending on the amount of units, UI indicated below (depending on bolus rendering setting). Meal Bolus \u2301 Carb Correction \u2301 Snack Bolus \u2301 These treatments allow you to enter the amount of food you eat (and eventually the matching insulin treatment). It will show as a circle with the higher half white (if including carbs), with its size depending on the amount of food. Without carbs the upper half will not be filled with the white color. If you add proteins and fat, the amount will display in this order: carbs/proteins/fat . With insulin the lower half of the circle will fill in blue and units will be indicated below. You can select the timing of carbs absorption in Carb Time (i.e. when did you or will you actually eat these carbs) Combo Bolus \u2301 Combo bolus allows you to insert the corresponding bolus if you use a pump. Insert the total amount of insulin in Insulin Given then break down in Split with the percentage administered now and the extended amount. Enter the Duration of the extended bolus below. It will display as a classic bolus at treatment time and basal will reflect the extended amount for the selected duration. Announcement \u2301 Announcements are used to change your page title in order to alert viewers. Entering another treatment will acknowledge the announcement and return your page title to default . Note \u2301 Question \u2301 Notes and questions are a way to add comments and interact with others using your Nightscout page.

You need basal to be enabled to visualize it. Profile Switch \u2301 If you have more than one profile stored, you can switch profile to keep your profile parameters synchronized. For a temporary switch (like for physical activities) you can select the duration. D.A.D. Alert \u2301 Log a Diabetic Alert Dog event. Edit Mode ( edit ) \u2301 For values still present on your display (last 48 hours), you can use Edit to move or delete bolus and correction treatments. will change color to red in edit mode . Drag the treatment in the past or future in the black area to move both food and insulin. If you want to move only insulin drop in the blue area. For carbs only, in the white area. To delete a complete treatment drop it in the red delete area. Once done, exit the edit mode by de-selecting it (white on black background). Drawer Menu \u2301 You'll find many features in the drawer menu like access to advanced plugins and customizations of your web page (local view only, in order to modify the default view look into your Heroku variables here ).

[+] - Create custom, simplified views using a predefined set of elements. List of available items: SGV - Sensor Glucose Value SGV age - time since the last SGV read SGV delta - change of SGV in the last 5 minutes Trend arrow - icon of the SG trend Time - current time Line break - invisible item that will move following items to the next line (by default all are showing on the same level) All visible items have Size property which allows to customize the view even more. Also, all items may appear multiple times on the view. Apart from adding items, it is possible to customize other aspects of the views, like selecting Color or Black background. The first one will indicate current BG threshold (green = in range; blue = below range; yellow = above range; red = urgent below/above). Show SGV age option will make SGV age item appear Always or only if the predefined threshold is reached: Only after threshold . Breaching SGV age threshold will also make Color background turn grey and strike through SGV . Clock view configurator will generate an URL (available under Open my clock view! link) that could be bookmarked. If you launch one of these views in a fullscreen view in iOS, you can use a left-to-right swipe gesture to exit the view. Settings: \u2301 You can customize your view using Settings.

By using IFTTT, you can have single button presses on your iPhone that will set an override, log a cannula change, log a sensor change and much more. Step 1: Get your API Secret Hash \u2301 First we need to gather one thing called your \"hashed API Secret\". In your internet browser, open a \"console\" window while viewing your Nightscout site. Make sure you have \"authenticated\" your site by using your API secret in the Nightscout settings area (hint: if you see a little padlock in the upper left corner of the site, you haven't authenticated it). Refresh the site and your hashed secret key will be shown as \"apisecrethash: \"xxxxxxxxxx...\"\" For Safari users on Mac , you can open the console window by selecting \"Develop\" from the Safari top menu, and then \"Show Page Source\" (if you do not see \"Develop\" in the top menu, activate it by going to Safari > Preferences... > Advanced, and checking the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" option). If you're having problems seeing the apisecrethash, click the little grey triangle next to the \"status isAuthenticated\" line and the objects below it will display (see screenshot). Your hashed API secret can be copied and pasted from that line, as shown below. Save that somewhere easy to get to again, because you will be using it later. For Chrome users , the console window is found through the View >> Developer >> View Source. Click on the Console tab and scroll to find the \"status isAuthenticated\" row to find your apisecrethash. Copy your API hash to somewhere you can retreive it again, we will be copy/pasting it in Step 2. Step 2: Create your \"Applets\" \u2301 IFTTT calls their little actions that you'll create an \"applet\". I have no idea why. But, I will go along and use their terminology so we are all consistent. We are basically interested in creating applets that will be buttons on your phone to do cool things in Nightscout. So, you'll have a button that will log when you changed your sensor last...letting you see in Nightscout easily just how old a sensor is at any given time. Or you can create a button that will turn on an \"exercise\" override that you already programmed into your kid's Loop app. So, let's make our first applet (aka button). Get an IFTTT account Login to your IFTTT.com account and select click this link to get to the page for creating your first \"New Applet\". (You can also get to this Applet creation page by selecting your Account icon in the upper right of the IFTTT website, then clicking on \"Create\".) In the screen that appears, click on the black \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"button\" in the search field and then click on the red box labelled \"ButtonWidget\" Connect the button widget by clicking on the large black\"connect\" button twice, once on the main screen and then second on the pop-up window that will appear immediately after that. (You will only have to \"connect\" the widgets for the first applet you make. After that the widgets will already connected to your IFTTT account.) Click on the large red \"button press\" box Click on the black \"+that\" text Enter \"Webhooks\" in the search field and click on the Webhooks app Connect the Webhooks app Select the blue \"Make a Web Request\" box Now you will have a blank web request template to complete. Screenshot below is an example of a completed recipe for eating soon IFTTT action. There are four parts you will need to fill in, and they are described below the screenshot. URL https://yoursite.herokuapp.com/api/v1/treatments.json (for all IFTTT recipes that are NOT remote overrides...so things like cannula changes, sensor changes, pump battery changes, etc.) Change the \"yoursite\" to your actual site's info. Method The method will be POST Content Type The content type will be application/json . Body The content of the body will depend on the action that you would like this particular button press to perform. While many recipes are available, any recipe that log carbs to NS will only display the carbs in Nightscout...Loop will not \"use\" those carbs in treatment or prediction math. The display of carbs in NS though may still be helpful for remote care givers to leave an indication that a low is being noticed and treated. Some sample content for actions that may be useful in Loop: Pump Site Change {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Site Change\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} CGM Sensor Start {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Sensor Start\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Note {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Note\", \"notes\": \"Hi mom, please don't text me for a bit. I'm taking a test.\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Special note for IFTTT to set a Remote Override with dev branch Triggering a remote override with IFTTT takes a couple considerations; 1. You have followed the directions for setting up remote overrides in Nightscout already. 2. Remote overrides will use https://yoursite.herokuapp.com/api/v2/notifications/loop for the URL line of the applet. Notice that is different from the other type of applets' URL. 3. The Body message of the applet needs to match the override already programmed in Loop app; the reason, reasonDisplay, and duration all need to match what is preset in your Loop app. The \"duration\" is giving in minutes in the body message (vs hours in Loop), and if the override is one that is \"enabled indefinitely\" then the duration is \"infinite\". The \"reason\" is the name of the override but NO EMOJI, and the \"reasonDisplay\" is the override name with the emoji. Check out the samples Body messages for overrides below. You will have to edit your body messages to match your reason and reasonDisplay. The target range and duration of the override does not need to be specified. Body message for override named \"hormones\" {\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"hormones\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hormones\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Body message for override named \"running\" {\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"running\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f running\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Body message for override named \"Low Treatment\" {\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"Low Treatment\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83c\udf6c Low Treatment\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Body message to cancel any override {\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override Cancel\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Click the Create Action button on the bottom of the screen when you finish. Now is your chance to change the title of your applet now to something meaningful. You can turn on notifications, too, using the slider shown. If you turn on the notifications, you will get an alert on your phone and pebble watch when the button press has been successfully deployed. Finish the IFTTT button by clicking on the Finish button that appears. Repeat the setup for new applets for as many automated actions/overrides as you would like to setup. Step 3: Enable IFTTT in your Nightscout site \u2301 Now that we have cool applets made, we need to give Nightscout some information so that it will accept commands from our applets. It's pretty simple to do...just a couple additions to your Heroku settings. Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account icon in upper right corner, choose \"My services\" and then click on the Webhooks service, settings. You will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL after the use/ ; copy and paste that last part (the red circled part as shown) Login to your Nightscout site host (azure or heroku) and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line. Step 4: Install IFTTT app on your iPhone/Android \u2301 Now that all the hard work is done, we can take easy street and just add that work to the phone via the IFTTT app. By accessing the IFTTT widget on your iPhone, you'll be able to easily and quickly access the useful buttons you've just created. Download the IFTTT app on your phone and log in using your IFTTT account. For iPhone users, if you swipe right from your iPhone's home screen, you will have the Today view showing. Scroll to the bottom, click \"edit\". This should show a list of existing widgets, followed by a list of \"more widgets\" with green + signs. Click on the IFTTT's green circle and the widget will be moved to the top, active widgets area. You can hold your finger on the three left lines of the IFTTT widget row to drag it to the top of your widget panel, if you prefer to have it as the top-most widget. If you end up with more than four IFTTT applets, they will appear in reverse-order of when they were created...which may not be the same as you'd prefer them to appear on your widget bar. If you'd like to reorder them: go into your iPhone's IFTTT app click on My Applets click on the gear icon in upper left of screen click on Widgets click on the pencil icon in upper right of screen click and hold the three lines that appear on the right side of the widget that you want to move. Drag the widget to the order in the list that you'd like it to appear in your widget quickscreen. Extra Credit: Alexa integration \u2301 Since you have IFTTT/Maker requests working, you can get it to work with anything that supports IFTTT, including Alexa. You will need to add \"alexa\" to your ENABLE line in your Heroku settings. And then repeat the steps above, but instead of using \"ButtonWidget\" service we started with earlier (the \"+if\" part of the setup)...you will use the \"AmazonAlexa\" service. Alexa requests do not need underscores, FYI.","title":"IFTTT Integration"},{"location":"nightscout/ifttt/#ifttt-integration","text":"If This, Then That (IFTTT) is a useful Nightscout integration.

Malicious code can be added to your Nightscout project by ill-intentioned people. Always make sure the version deployed is a fork of the official project. After receiving help a good practice is to change your account passwords (GitHub, Heroku, mongoDB Atlas, Clarity, CareLink, ...) and your API secret.

In many Facebook groups, you\u2019ll find open-hearted people ready to help you building it. For free. Paying it forward. If you want to sell installations , keep in mind you will be legally liable and can easily be sued by your buyers should anything bad happen to them because of Nightscout. Nightscout is not approved by FDA, CE, ... this is the reason why it's DIY. Security and safekeeping \u2301 Use the same email address for all accounts. Do not use a disposable email address. Do not use the same password for all your accounts. Do not use the API_SECRET for the Atlas database password. Do not use your Dexcom or CareLink user name or password for Nightscout components. Print this document to record all information. Store it together with your diabetes documentation. Here is a step-by-step guide for completing your own Nightscout site DIY style. \u2301 Create your Heroku, GitHub, and Atlas accounts from a computer. \u2301 Do not change device/computer/browser during the creation process! Note If you have unexpected issues whilst creating your site restart with another browser. If this is not your first attempt to deploy Nightscout You might want to do some cleanup before. Step 1: Create a GitHub account \u2301 If you already have a GitHub account and previously forked cgm-remote-monitor Make sure you delete your current cgm-remote-monitor fork using Step 1 of this guide (ONLY STEP1!) . Note You do not need several GitHub accounts for several Nightscout sites. One is enough as you can connect it to multiple Heroku apps and accounts. Click this link to create a GitHub account: https://github.com/ Enter a username (anything you want and that is accepted, not very important), email, and password. Then click Sign up for GitHub Play and solve the puzzle then click Join a free plan . Select whatever choices (not important) then click Complete setup . GitHub will send you a verification email. Open your mailbox and check for it (look into SPAM, too). On the received email, click Verify email address . A new page will open in your browser, click Skip this for now . Leave the page open as it is. Step 2: Create a Heroku account \u2301 Click this link to create an Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/login Enter mandatory data (*) and click CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Heroku will send a confirmation email, open your mailbox and look for it (also check your SPAM folder). Click on the activation link Create a password and write it down. Click SET PASSWORD AND LOG IN Click CLICK HERE TO PROCEED Your Heroku page will open, click on your profile picture top right and select Account Settings Click on Billing Click Add credit card Enter a valid credit card information and click Save Details Note Unless you voluntarily select billable features, your credit card information is only used for verifications and you will not be charged anything. Worst case you\u2019ll be charged $0.00 You should now have 2 pages open: Heroku and GitHub. Leave them open. Step 3: Create an Atlas account \u2301 Open another tab at: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and click Start Free Enter information then click Get Started Free Select Create a cluster in Shared Clusters (FREE) Leave all default values and click Create Cluster Atlas will create your default cluster, wait until completion\u2026 (can take more than 3 minutes) Click on CONNECT Click on Allow Access from Anywhere If you don't allow access from anywhere (IP 0.0.0.0/0) Nightscout will not be able to access your database. Click on Add IP Address Add a database username (for example nightscout ) and a database password (in the example below soo5ecret ). Database credentials: Do not use your Atlas account credentials. Do not use special characters: only letters and numbers. Write down these credentials in the boxes below (yes, in this browser window you're reading now, unless you're reading a printed version). You\u2019ll need them later. Database password: Database username: Then click Create Database User . Click on Choose a connection method Select Connect your application Copy the connection string: click Copy and paste it somewhere to edit it (like Notepad). Paste the string in the box below (yes, in this browser window you're reading now, unless you're reading a printed version). It should be similar to this ( xxxxx will be different): mongodb+srv://nightscout:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority Click the Generate button (just here below this line: in this browser window you're reading): Generate The connection string will appear here var bAtlas; var sdB, sPwd; var sFinalString = \"Not defined yet\"; function Generate() { var sString = sFinalString; bAtlas=0; var sString = \"Looks good!\"; var sAtlas = document.getElementById(\"myAtlas\").value; sPwd = document.getElementById(\"myPwd\").value; sdB = document.getElementById(\"mydB\").value; var iAS = sAtlas.search(\"://\"); if(iAS!=11) { sString = \"Atlas URI should start with mongodb+srv://\"; } else { var iAP = sAtlas.search(\"<password>\"); if(iAP==-1) { sString = \"Atlas URI should contain &lt;password&gt;\"; } else { var iAD = sAtlas.search(\"<dbname>\"); if(iAD==-1) { sString = \"Atlas URI should contain &lt;dbname&gt;\"; } else { bAtlas=1; sString = sAtlas.substring(0,iAP); sFinalString = sString.concat(sPwd, sAtlas.substring(iAP+10, iAD)); sString = sAtlas.substring(iAP+10, iAD); sFinalString = sFinalString.concat(sdB, sAtlas.substring(iAD+8)); } } } if(bAtlas) document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = sFinalString; else document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = sString; } Warning Keep this string safely aside, it is called your MONGODB_URI If you want to do it manually: replace <password> with your database password as noted previously (in the example below soo5ecret ) and <dbname> by any text you want, say mycgmic for example. The result will be like this: mongodb+srv://nightscout:soo5ecret@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mycgmic?retryWrites=true&w=majority Note There are no < and > characters in the final string, neither for password nor for database name. Step 4: Fork and deploy cgm-remote-monitor \u2301 If you previously forked cgm-remote-monitor before reaching this step, you should delete the existing cgm-remote-monitor repository before proceeding Delete your current cgm-remote-monitor fork using Step 1 of this guide (ONLY STEP1!) . You should now have 3 pages opened in your browser: Heroku, Atlas, and Github. Make sure you are logged-in on each one (i.e. not asking you to login) before you continue. Click this link https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor , a new GitHub page will open. Click on Fork Wait a moment Scroll down and click Deploy to Heroku You're getting into the core setup of your site Below you'll see the minimum required configuration, you can modify the variables later in Heroku. A more complete list here: Setup Enter your CGM in the Cloud site name: invent a name you will use to see your BG in the cloud. Check the name is available. Don\u2019t change the region. Scroll down and setup the following variables: API_SECRET will be your Nightscout site password, it needs to be at least 12 characters long and should NOT use spaces and @ or ! symbols : it is recommended to use only letters and numbers. The API_SECRET is the main password allowing full access to your Nightscout site . Make sure it's reasonably secure (mix uppercase and lowercase letters, plus numbers) and do no not share it publicly . If you think you exposed it by mistake, it is recommended that you change it . If you want to link your Dexcom Share account as a data source, compile the following lines: MOST COMMON ERRORS The BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME are NOT visible from within your Dexcom app or online account. The values for them are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you VERY FIRST logged into that app however long ago. The BRIDGE_USER_NAME is not an email address. The most common error on initial Nightscout setups is that people incorrectly use an old account or an old password. To test your username and password, go to Dexcom's Clarity page (check here for USA accounts and here for the others ) and try logging into your Dexcom account. If your account info doesn't let you in, or you don't see data in your Clarity account...then you need to figure out your actual credentials before moving ahead. Password Some people have had problems with their bridge connecting when their Dexcom passwords are entirely numeric. If you have connection issues in that case, try changing your password to something with a mix of numbers and letters. Info You need to have at least one follower to use Dexcom Share. See here . If you want to link your CareLink account as a data source, compile the following lines: Select the units you\u2019re using in DISPLAY_UNITS acceptable choices are mg/dl or mmol/L (or just mmol ). In ENABLE copy and paste the following words (separated by a space) so that you won't have to think about which you want now: careportal basal dbsize rawbg iob maker bridge cob bwp cage iage sage boluscalc pushover treatmentnotify mmconnect loop pump profile food openaps bage alexa override speech cors More on ENABLE words If you want to know more about them, look here: Setup Now you need that connection string you defined during the Atlas cluster creation (as the example below, but not the string below). Copy and paste it in the MONGODB_URI variable field. mongodb+srv://nightscout:soo5ecret@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mycgmic?retryWrites=true&w=majority Browse down to the end of the list and click Deploy app WAIT until completion (will take some time). Do not interfere with the process until it's complete. Then click View (if nothing happens click Manage App then in the upper right Open App ) Your Nightscout site should open, click on the hamburger menu top right and select Profile Editor . Setup your Time zone and eventually all other fields. Do not leave fields empty. If you don't know which value you should use, just leave default. You can change them later. Browse down to Authentication status and click Authenticate . Enter your API secret. Click Update . Click Save . If the following pop-up shows up click OK , and check status (upper right of the window). Privacy warning Having the URL of your Nightscout site, anybody can view your BG and run reports of your data. It it strongly recommended that you secure your site once you're done with setup. Dexcom Share and CareLink users should see data flowing in after some minutes. Other uploaders like xDrip+, Spike, xDrip4iOS, etc will need to be setup with the Nightscout address and API secret in the app. Papertrail \u2301 Finally, you might want to modify the PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN line. Heroku offers a free, tiny amount of Papertrail service (like a logging service for how the site is running), but really generates more confusion to most people later when they get a message that their \"Free Papertrail Service has run out of room\". Papertrail is not needed, edit the line and add DISABLED at the end, so that you can recover the function should you need it.

We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover. Traditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site. The old Loop docs had set up for how to add your PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY , PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , and PUSHOVER_USER_KEY in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers. The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine-tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgment requirement. If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself. Using Pushover THROUGH IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones. For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her Dexcom is about to expire in the next day. S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures. Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too. If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue. A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alert when the school nurse boluses for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful. Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily. The basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was \"Maker Webhooks\" hence you may see references to \"maker\" in NS docs). Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT. For this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called ns-event . You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification. As a brief roadmap for what we are going to do: Get necessary accounts setup Add a folder to your Google Drive Make an IFTTT applet to log NS events to your Google Spreadsheets Enable NS to work with that new IFTTT applet Make an IFTTT applet to send Pushover alert when the Google Spreadsheet is updated Get Prepped \u2301 If you don't already have these steps done, you will need them. Skip any that you already have done. Setup a Nightscout site Get an IFTTT account Get a Pushover Account Get a Google Account Download the Pushover app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to receive Pushover alerts Download the IFTTT app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to use IFTTT applets on Login to the Pushover and IFTTT apps with your login information Add a Google Drive folder \u2301 Login to your Google account and select Google Drive Click on the blue \"New\" button and create a new folder named IFTTT. Double click on the newly created IFTTT folder, select the blue \"New\" button again, and create a new subfolder called \"Nightscout-Alarms\" This IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will eventually contain numerous Google Spreadsheets, one for each NS alarm or information that is logged. As new alarms are triggered, the IFTTT applet we are about to write will add a row to the appropriate spreadsheet logging the time of the alarm and any other reported details that go with the entry. For now though, your drive will be blank...screenshot below just to give you an idea of where we are going. Make 1st IFTTT Applet to Log NS Alarms \u2301 Login to your IFTTT.com account and select the \"New Applet\" button. In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"webhooks\" in the search field and then click on the blue connect button If this is the first time you are using IFTTT Webhooks service, you will have a \"Connect\" button to select. If you already have IFTTT applets using Webhooks, you won't see this screen...just move to the next bullet. Click on the \"receive a web request\" blue box, and then fill in the Event Name as ns-event and then press the \"Create trigger\" button. (Side note: the event name used here corresponds to the triggers discussed above for core events that NS already has integrated for IFTTT users. If you want to, instead, use the other triggers such as ns-warn or ns-urgent, you can. This example is using the most general trigger so that the options are wider for most users.) Click on the blue \"+that\" text Enter google in the search field and click on the Google Sheets icon Select the green \"Add row to spreadsheet\" box Delete the contents of the \"Spreadsheet Name\" and \"Drive folder path\". For the \"Spreadsheet Name\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and select the \"Value1\". For the \"Drive folder path\", enter IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms . You do not have to modify the \"Formatted row\" box's contents. Click the \"Create action\" button at the bottom. Turn off the toggle for receiving notifications when the applet runs, and then click the Finish button You'll now have the finished IFTTT applet that will cause a row to be added to a Google spreadsheet...tracking all your NS notifications and alarms. If it is the first time that alarm has been logged, the applet will also create the spreadsheet itself. After a while, your IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will start to look like the screenshot posted above with numerous spreadsheets for each alarm type. Enable IFTTT Webhooks in your Nightscout site \u2301 If you already have created IFTTT buttons previously to work with your NS site, you can skip this section. If those buttons are working, then you've already added your MAKER_KEY and \"maker\" to your ENABLE line in Heroku. To actually make that first applet work, we need to enter a \"Maker Key\" to get NS and IFTTT talking to each other. Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account, Services and then clicking on Webhooks. (Your screen may not have as many services showing; the example account below just happens to already use several services.) You will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL; copy that last part (the red circled part) Navigate to your Heroku account's settings tab, \"reveal config vars\" and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line. Make 2nd IFTTT Applet to send Pushover notifications \u2301 In your IFTTT account, select the \"New Applet\" button. In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"google\" in the search field and then click on the \"Google Sheets\" logo. Click on the \"New row added to spreadsheet\" as the trigger. Enter the following information: Folder path is IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms and for the filename you are going to enter the name of the particular NS alarm or information that you would like to get pushover alerts for. Click on the \"Create trigger\" button to save the trigger. This applet can't be created unless your filename (alarm spreadsheet) already exists. If your 1st applet we created above hasn't run for a long time, the spreadsheets may not exist yet because the alarms haven't triggered. You have two options...(1) manually create the file in your Google Drive so that you can finish the applet now or (2) wait several days/weeks for the alarms to happen and that will automatically create the files in your Google drive. If you choose option 1, here's a partial list of some of the filenames you could create in advance: Loop isn't looping Cannula age 48 hours Cannula age 72 hours Meal Bolus Warning, Pump Reservoir Low Warning Uploader Battery is Low Temporary Override Depending on your alert levels you specified in NS, some of the hours in the titles may vary to match your settings Click on the blue \"+that\" text Enter pushover in the search field and click on the Pushover icon. If this is your first time linking your IFTTT to Pushover, you will be prompted to enter your Pushover account login and allow IFTTT access. This only needs to be done once. Select the \"Send a Pushover notification\" box Delete the contents of the \"Title\" and \"Message\" and \"URL\" boxes. For the Title, click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add ColumnC . For the \"Message\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add the values of various columns from your spreadsheet for the information you would like to include. For the alerts: ColumnC contains the alarm name, ColumnA is the date/time of the alarm, and ColumnD has more detailed information about the info/alarm. This is a pretty decent recipe to follow to get the useful information in your notification. Select the \"Message Priority\" that you would like for this particular alarm type. Select the \"Device\" that you would like to receive this particular alarm type. The devices listed will be all your devices that have Pushover app installed and logged into. Click \"Create Action\" when you are finished. You'll now have made the IFTTT applet that will cause a Pushover notification to a particular device for a particular NS alarm, once the first applet records the alarm in the google spreadsheet. Keep the \"receive notification when this Applet runs\" toggled off and click the Finish button. Revisit Nightscout Alert Levels \u2301 Putting all these notifications together may cause you to want to revisit the alert levels you have set in your Heroku settings. Here's a short summary of NS for the looping-related alerts (Note: the last row, Upbat, is the Looping iPhone battery level for Loop users; or the rig's battery level for OpenAPS users.) If you'd like some of these alarms for your site and don't currently have them activated (they are all off by default unless specifically turned on), the lines you'd need to add are in the last column. If you like the default values of the WARN and/or URGENT, you don't have to add those extra lines...just the line to enable the alerts will be sufficient. SETTING DEFAULT WARN DEFAULT URGENT HEROKU SETTINGS CAGE 48 72 CAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true CAGE_WARN=XX CAGE_URGENT=XX SAGE 164 168 SAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true SAGE_WARN=XX SAGE_URGENT=XX IAGE 48 72 IAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true IAGE_WARN=XX IAGE_URGENT=XX LOOP 30 60 LOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true LOOP_WARN=XX LOOP_URGENT=XX OPENAPS 30 60 OPENAPS_ENABLE_ALERTS = true OPENAPS_WARN=XX OPENAPS_URGENT=XX PUMP_CLOCK 30 60 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_CLOCK=XX PUMP_URGENT_CLOCK=XX PUMP_RES 10 5 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_RES=XX PUMP_URGENT_RES=XX PUMP_BATT_P 30 20 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_P=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_P=XX PUMP_BATT_V 1.35 1.30 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_V=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_V=XX UPBAT 30 20 UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS = true UPBAT_WARN=XX UPBAT_URGENT=XX Final notes \u2301 You can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet. For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iPhone instead of Pushover. The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily. Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service. This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows. If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices. To be clear, you do NOT need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have PUSHOVER_USER_KEY , PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , or PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work. This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into its code. This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup. To create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for. You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collector). Here are examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet. After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet. For most alarms, it may take quite some time to reach 2000 rows of info. For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper. You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.","title":"Remote notifications"},{"location":"nightscout/pushover/#remote-notifications","text":"While Loop app currently sends notifications locally on Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers likely want those messages on their phones, too.

You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collector). Here are examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet. After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet. For most alarms, it may take quite some time to reach 2000 rows of info. For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper. You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.","title":"Final notes"},{"location":"nightscout/reports/","text":"Reports \u2301 Nightscout offers some fantastic data-crunching report tools in the drawer menu, Select Reports to open the reports page.

UPBAT_WARN ( 30 ) - Minimum battery percent to trigger warning. UPBAT_URGENT ( 20 ) - Minimum battery percent to trigger urgent alarm. timeago (Time Ago) \u2301 Displays the time since last CGM entry. Use these extended setting to adjust behavior: TIMEAGO_ENABLE_ALERTS ( false ) - Set to true to enable stale data alarms via Pushover and IFTTT. ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN ( on ) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN_MINS ( 15 ) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a warning ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT ( on ) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT_MINS ( 30 ) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a urgent alarm devicestatus (Device Status) \u2301 Used by upbat and other plugins to display device status info. Supports the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED=\"true\" extended setting to send all device statuses to the client for retrospective use and to support other plugins. Example: upbat information using devicestatus . errorcodes (CGM Error Codes) \u2301 Generates alarms for CGM codes 9 (hourglass) and 10 (???). Use extended settings to adjust what errorcodes trigger notifications and alarms: ERRORCODES_INFO ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ) - By default the needs calibration (blood drop) and other codes below 9 generate an info level notification, set to a space separate list of number or off to disable ERRORCODES_WARN ( off ) - By default there are no warning configured, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ERRORCODES_URGENT ( 9 10 ) - By default the hourglass and ??? generate an urgent alarm, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ar2 (AR2 Forecasting) \u2301 Generates alarms based on forecasted values. See Forecasting using AR2 algorithm Enabled by default if no thresholds are set OR ALARM_TYPES includes predict . AR2 forecasting display can be enabled/disabled from ... Use extended settings to adjust AR2 behavior: AR2_CONE_FACTOR ( 2 ) - to adjust size of cone, use 0 for a single line. simplealarms (Simple BG Alarms) \u2301 Uses BG_HIGH , BG_TARGET_TOP , BG_TARGET_BOTTOM , BG_LOW thresholds to generate alarms. Simple alarms are enabled by default if one of the BG_HIGH , BG_TARGET_TOP , BG_TARGET_BOTTOM , BG_LOW thresholds is set or ALARM_TYPES includes simple . You'll find the plugin in the drawer menu. You can change thresholds in Profile editor . You can click the loudspeaker icon to test the alarms volume or to snooze an active alarm. If you want to use sound alarms, you should click the icon to enable playback at least once after opening your Nightscout page in order to allow the browser to play it. profile (Treatment Profile) \u2301 Add a link in the drawer menu to Profile Editor and allows to enter treatment profile settings. Also uses the extended setting: PROFILE_HISTORY ( off ) - possible values on or off . Enable/disable NS ability to keep history of your profiles (still experimental) PROFILE_MULTIPLE ( off ) - possible values on or off . Enable/disable NS ability to handle and switch between multiple treatment profiles More variables of your profile will be used by Nightscout plugins like treatments, see below or here . dbsize (Database Size) \u2301 Show size of Nightscout Database, as a percentage of declared available space or in MiB. Many deployments of Nightscout use free tier of MongoDB Atlas on Heroku, which is limited in size to 512MiB. After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration. NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size. NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only . It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise. All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B Extended settings available: DBSIZE_MAX ( 496 ) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE ( 60 ) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE ( 75 ) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS ( false ) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB ( false ) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. Advanced Plugins: \u2301 careportal (Careportal) \u2301 An optional form to enter treatments. Care Portal is an important plugin that gives access to the Log a treatment interface. Unlock it entering your API secret with the lock icon top right, then use the + icon to log a treatment.

You can access it with the calculator icon top right. food (Custom Foods) \u2301 Custom Foods enabled by the variable food allows to to customize your food database and adds a Food Editor entry in the menu. rawbg (Raw BG) \u2301 Calculates BG using sensor and calibration records from and displays an alternate BG values and noise levels. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting. Raw BG will only display if your sensor provides this data, your bridge device transfers it and your uploader sends it to Nightscout. DISPLAY ( unsmoothed ) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. \u200b unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exaggerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) - cob (Carbs-on-Board) \u2301 iob (Insulin-on-Board) \u2301 Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins.

Uses treatments with carb doses and the carbs_hr , carbratio , and sens fields from the treatment profile. When you enter the information with the Care Portal or Nightscout receives if from the uploader, you can see remaining insulin on board and carbs. bwp (Bolus Wizard Preview) \u2301 This plugin in intended for the purpose of automatically snoozing alarms when the CGM indicates high blood sugar but there is also insulin on board (IOB) and secondly, alerting to user that it might be beneficial to measure the blood sugar using a glucometer and dosing insulin as calculated by the pump or instructed by trained medicare professionals. The values provided by the plugin are provided as a reference based on CGM data and insulin sensitivity you have configured, and are not intended to be used as a reference for bolus calculation. The plugin calculates the bolus amount when above your target, generates alarms when you should consider checking and bolusing, and snoozes alarms when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. Uses the results of the iob plugin and sens , target_high , and target_low fields from the treatment profile . Defaults that can be adjusted with extended settings BWP_WARN ( 0.50 ) - If BWP is > BWP_WARN a warning alarm will be triggered. BWP_URGENT ( 1.00 ) - If BWP is > BWP_URGENT an urgent alarm will be triggered. BWP_SNOOZE_MINS ( 10 ) - minutes to snooze when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG.

When enabled, speaks out the blood glucose values, IOB and alarms. Note you have to set the LANGUAGE setting on the server to get all translated alarms. cors (CORS) \u2301 Enabled CORS so other websites can make request to your Nightscout site, uses these extended settings: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN ( * ) - The list of sites that are allow to make requests dbsize (Database Size) \u2301 Show size of Nightscout Database, as a percentage of declared available space or in MiB. Many deployments of Nightscout use free tier of MongoDB Atlas on Heroku, which is limited in size to 512MiB. After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration.

NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only . It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise. All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B Extended settings available: DBSIZE_MAX ( 496 ) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE ( 60 ) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE ( 75 ) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS ( false ) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB ( false ) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. Extended Settings \u2301 Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _ . For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin. Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser. DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED ( true ) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS ( 1 ) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover \u2301 In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications. To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account. Using that account login to Pushover , in the top left you\u2019ll see your User Key, you\u2019ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup. You\u2019ll need to Create a Pushover Application . You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch. Maybe you'd like to use this one ? Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables: * `ENABLE` - `pushover` should be added to the list of plugin, for example: `ENABLE=\"pushover\"`. * `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN` - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in [Pushover](https://pushover.net/), ***[additional pushover information](#pushover)*** below. * `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user. This also supports a space delimited list of keys. To disable `INFO` level pushes set this to `off`. * `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY` - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level > `WARN`). If not defined this will fallback to `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY`. A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Alarm pushes set this to `off`. * `PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY` - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` or `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY`. This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to `off`. * `BASE_URL` - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible. * `API_SECRET` - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments. If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=\"off\"` If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use `PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY=\"off\"` If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use `PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY=\"off\"` If only `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements For testing/development try [localtunnel](http://localtunnel.me/). IFTTT Maker \u2301 In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for IFTTT Webhooks . With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other IFTTT Services . For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more. Setup IFTTT account: login or create an account Follow the Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables: ENABLE - maker should be added to the list of plugins, for example: ENABLE=\"maker\" . MAKER_KEY - Set this to your secret key (see [ Detailed Instructions ) MAKER_KEY=\"abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p\" This also supports a space delimited list of keys. MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to MAKER_KEY . A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns- . The core events are: ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event . ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event . ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event . see the full list of events Treatment Profile \u2301 Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor . Treatment Profile Fields: timezone (Time Zone) - time zone local to the patient. Should be set. units (Profile Units) - blood glucose units used in the profile, either \"mg/dl\" or \"mmol\" dia (Insulin duration) - value should be the duration of insulin action to use in calculating how much insulin is left active. Defaults to 3 hours. carbs_hr (Carbs per Hour) - The number of carbs that are processed per hour, for more information see #DIYPS . carbratio (Carb Ratio) - grams per unit of insulin. sens (Insulin sensitivity) How much one unit of insulin will normally lower blood glucose. basal The basal rate set on the pump. target_high - Upper target for correction boluses. target_low - Lower target for correction boluses.","title":"Configure your Nightscout"},{"location":"nightscout/setup_variables/#nightscout-configuration","text":"","title":"Nightscout Configuration"},{"location":"nightscout/setup_variables/#editing-config-vars-in-heroku","text":"Once Nightscout deployed, you can access your variables from Heroku .

Many deployments of Nightscout use free tier of MongoDB Atlas on Heroku, which is limited in size to 512MiB. After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration. NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size. NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only . It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases.

If you're still trying to deploy your first Nightscout, ignore all data loss recommendations below. If you have a large amount of CGM data, be extra cautious when performing Atlas cleanup. Github \u2301 Github cleanup consists of deleting your fork and forking again the official latest released version . Follow Step 1 of this guide (ONLY STEP1!) . Heroku \u2301 If you experience issues during deployment you might end up with many apps. Make sure you keep the last one that was functional or delete all before attempting a new deployment. This will just make it easier to find which app you're trying to build. Keeping sleeping apps doesn't have any negative impact but no real advantage unless you do it on purpose. Deleting an Heroku app does not delete your Nightscout data, but you might want to write down your variables if your site was functional before. Note you can also rename an app (unless the name is already in use in heroku.com). To delete an app, select it and go to Settings , scroll down to Delete App Copy and paste your app name to confirm deletion, Atlas \u2301 It is very easy to get lost in Atlas. The structure from top to bottom is: Organization, Projects and Databases. You can have several organizations, each of them several projects and each of them several databases. Note If you are deploying a brand new Nightscout make sure you have one organization, one project and one cluster created. No more no less. If you want to cleanup Atlas, unless you don't have data, you must first find out which database contains your data. For this, start from View All Organizations : You can delete empty organizations (those without any project inside). Select the organization, then top left the cog wheel to go in Settings , then scroll down to Delete Organization : Delete .

You must have bridge and careportal on the ENABLE line (you can have other values there...but don't forget these two). If you are outside the USA, you must add BRIDGE_SERVER set to EU in Heroku settings. Your careportal must be one word in the ENABLE line, sometimes autocorrect makes it two words. If using mmol , make sure you have spelled that value correctly in the DISPLAY_UNITS . One thing that can happen if you have an incorrect Dexcom login/password in your Share account settings and/or in your Nightscout BRIDGE settings is that Dexcom will lock your account...and you won't see CGM data in Nightscout. If you notice your CGM readings disappeared, but everything else is flowing...check your Heroku logs that are viewable by selecting \"View Logs\" from the drop-down menu underneath the \"More\" option. Do your logs have \"SSO authentication errors\" like in the red box highlighted above? If you do, then: Delete your BRIDGE entries within Heroku settings. Don't delete the variables, just delete the values of BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME. Wait 15 minutes and then follow the directions below. It is important to wait 15 minutes: the reason you can't log in right now is that your Dexcom account has a temporary lock from the passwords in the step above being incorrect. The temporary lock will expire after 10-15 minutes of giving the account login a break from the incorrect logins. So, definitely wait or else you'll just keep prolonging the issue. When you change these variables, Heroku restarts Nightscout. So now everything should work. About your Bridge password and user name The BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME are NOT visible from within your Dexcom mobile app or online account. The values of them are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you VERY FIRST logged into that app however long ago. If you have double-checked everything else that could be incorrect and BGs still aren't showing in Nightscout, then you likely have those Bridge values incorrect. To fix that, delete your Dexcom app (don't stop the session before deleting the app...just keep it going). Download the app again from the iPhone's App Store and login to the freshly-downloaded Dexcom app. Take note that deleting the app will not stop your session, your session will pick right back up once the transmitter pairs again. The BRIDGE_USER_NAME is not an email address. Use that exact same login now in your Heroku settings. You can leave your Loop's Share account info blank...you just need the transmitter ID going forward. Dexcom username issue \u2301 It seems that Dexcom share somewhere in its systems is not capable of using the username other than ordinary letters. By changing the username, this has been solved for everyone who has tried so far. If that doesn't work for you, please report it at https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/issues/5608 or if you can comment on any Facebook post that linked to this site. Change username \u2301 Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the username of a Dexcom account. You have to create a whole new account. Create new account \u2301 You can only associate one email address with a Dexcom account, so it might be a good idea to create a new email address and associate it to your current account so that you can use your current email with the new account. Go to https://www.dexcom.com and look for where to create accounts. Follow the instructions to create a new account. The alternative is to delete the old account. But do not do that. It may be good to be able to go back and retrieve historical data. Make sure the new username contains only letters. It is better to stick to a-z. We know that the period . underscore _ and at @ characters creates problems, but we do not know which other characters can create problems. Reinstall Dexcom Transmitter app \u2301 When you install the Dexcom app, it is linked to a Dexcom account. Unfortunately, there is no way to switch accounts. What you have to do is simply uninstall the app and reinstall it. In principle, it is the same procedure as changing phone. Of course, this time you should log in with the new account. Write down the current Transmitter ID. You can find the ID if you look in settings in the Dexcom app. Uninstall the Dexcom app Reinstall the Dexcom app Log in with your new account Follow the instructions in the app. For G6 do not select sensor code. The sensor code is already saved on your old transmitter. Enter the transmitter ID and wait for pairing Answer yes to the question \"have you inserted sensor\" You then have to re-invite your followers. Nightscout \u2301 Check your Heroku settings match your new credentials (see above) Dexcom or CareLink data stopping after a while \u2301 First verify you can see your BG in Clarity or CareLink. If data is present open Heroku and check you app didn't fall asleep. A sleeping app might be due to your Heroku free plan: a Hobby plan makes the app never sleep. https://www.heroku.com/pricing Another reason for a sleeping app can be due to a failure to obtain data from Dexcom Share or CareLink, check the logs to understand the reasons. Note Some users report CareLink with mmconnect data source stopped functioning. If this is your case update Nightscout to the latest released version (min 14.1) and if it doesn't fix the issue, remove the mmconnect plugin from ENABLE until a solution is found . UpTime Robot Using an uptime robot with a bad password, or other issues originating from Nightscout can lead to a locked account (Dexcom) or Heroku addresses ban (CareLink). This is not a recommended solution as it might generate a global Heroku IP blacklist lock that could propagate to all other users. If you use Nightscout, uploading data in the cloud or even just having a browser or an app downloading data should be enough to keep your app awake. Error code instead of a BG value \u2301 Nightscout implements Dexcom error codes as listed below: Code Corresponding error ?SN Sensor not active ?MD Minimal deviation ?NA No antenna ?NC Sensor not calibrated ?CD Counts deviation ?AD Absolute deviation ??? Power deviation ?RF Bad RF Data timing issues \u2301 Basal is shifted in time \u2301 Check the time zone is correct for your currently active profile in your Nightscout Profile editor . Data in the future \u2301 Check you don't have data in the future with the Admin tools . Remove them if existing. If this isn't working, or shows no future data, check in Atlas Open your Nightscout cluster and select Collections In Entries type {date:-1} and click Find Delete the entries in the future (manually) with the bin icon Database full \u2301 Free databases like M0 Sandbox provided by Atlas will only hold a limited amount of data (512MB) and you will eventually need to manually cleanup. You can extend the capacity to 2 and 5GB paying an M2 or M5 Shared cluster. Make sure your Nightscout site has Database Size enabled to monitor database capacity. Look here for more information on this plugin. Check in Atlas Open your Nightscout cluster and select Collections Click your database name (hidden left).

If you are reluctant to lose historical data you should consider opting for a paid database solution. Reports slow loading or timeout \u2301 Loopers might experience Nightscout taking an extremely long time or even timing out when creating reports due to the profiles collection database growing too big.

This can be either an electronic solution (usually for older devices), or just a simple app installed on your phone (for most newer systems) that connects to the sensor/pump and then uploads this data. The type of Uploader needed will depend on the type of CGM system being used. In this page, we will break the different systems down by manufacturer, then further by sensor type. Once you are clear about the type of sensor and upload system you will be using, you can find detailed configuration information for each one here . Dexcom \u2301 Dexcom G5/G6 \u2301 If you are using the Dexcom G5 and G6 sensors connected to the Dexcom app on your phone, it will upload directly to the Dexcom servers (also still known as \"Dexcom Share\") and you won't need to use any extra uploader or master device. For this to work, Nightscout must be configured to use the bridge plug-in and will then automatically pull the CGM information directly from the Dexcom servers in real-time. Please note that at this time (early 2021), the Dexcom G5 system is effectively obsolete but many people are still using stocks of old sensors and transmitters. If you don't want to use the official Dexcom apps, then you can use open-source software apps for your Dexcom sensor to connect, display, alarm and also upload to Nightscout: Android : xDrip+ for G4, G5 and G6. iOS : Spike or xDrip4iOS for G4, G5 and older G6 transmitters ( not Firefly ) Dexcom \"Firefly\" Transmitters Any transmitter made before Dexcom switched to the \"firefly\" range of G6 transmitters is compatible with Spike or xDrip4iOS . Although there are slight physical differences, the easiest way to check is to look at the Transmitter ID. If it starts with 80xxxx or 81yxxx (where y is a number) then it is a pre-Firefly transmitter and is compatible. Most of the useable transmitters that fall into this category at the present time (early 2021) are generally rebatteried or rechargeable/modified 80xxxx or 81xxxx transmitters. Loop and AAPS will upload your data directly to Nightscout and will act as uploaders. Dexcom G4 (now obsolete) \u2301 The Dexcom G4 system is now Dexcom G4 requires additional hardware, like a Wixel , an xDripKit or a compatible Android phone with an OTG cable connected to the receiver. Dexcom G4 Platinum (Share) requires you to carry the receiver to forward data to the uploader. Medtronic \u2301 If your sensor system is able to directly upload to CareLink then Nightscout will be able to get the information directly from the cloud using the mmconnect plugin (not valid for the newer 780G pump). If this isn't an option and your sensor/transmitter is connected to your pump (Medtronic 600 series pumps), then you'll need an Android phone connected with an OTG cable to your pump's connected glucose meter. The phone will need to run the 600 Series Uploader app. Abbott Freestyle Libre \u2301 Non Bluetooth-enabled Freestyle Libre sensors will need an additional transmitter device fixed on top of the sensor to send readings to the uploader device. In release order here are some transmitter options: LimiTTer , BlueReader, Blucon, MiaoMiao, Bubble, and Droplet. Transmitter Compatibility The Libre environment is complex and evolves quickly. Before buying a transmitter, please join the respective Facebook groups and make sure that the transmitter you are planning to buy is compatible with your sensor type. Most of the transmitters have their own proprietary apps. Nearly all of these support the uploading of data to Nightscout (LinkBluCon, Tomato, Diabox, eDroplet, ...). Again, check the transmitter manufacturer's website and the relevant Facebook support groups for information. Open-source apps such as xDrip+ , Spike and xDrip4iOS also support most of the above transmitter devices. For Android uploader devices, this is the possibility to directly connect to the Libre 2 sensor (EU only) without an additional transmitter. Please read here for more information.

It is being developed in the context of github-bookeditor , an EPUB3 Textbook editor for GitHub. This package can also be used in nodejs or as an AMD module in the browser. Key Features \u2301 Works in nodejs , an AMD module in the browser, and as a bower library Handles text and binary files Exposes everything available via the GitHub API (repos, teams, events, hooks, emojis, etc.) Supports ETag caching Paged results Node-style callbacks as well as optional Promises (to avoid those debates) 100% of the GitHub API Starring and Following repositories, users, and organizations Editing Team and Organization Membership User/Org/Repo events and notifications Listeners for rate limit changes Public Keys Hooks (commit, comment, etc.) Uses Angular, jQuery, or native promises if available Markdown generation Preview APIs (Deployments, Teams, etc) Enterprise APIs For the full list of supported methods see the Travis tests , the ./test directory, or ./src/grammar.coffee . Usage \u2301 All asynchronous methods accept a Node.js-style callback and return a Common-JS Promise . In a browser without RequireJS \u2301 Create an Octokat instance. var octo = new Octokat({ username: \"USER_NAME\", password: \"PASSWORD\" }); var cb = function (err, val) { console.log(val); }; octo.zen.read(cb); octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch(cb); // Fetch repo info octo.me.starred('philschatz', 'octokat.js').add(cb); // Star a repo Or if you prefer OAuth: var octo = new Octokat({ token: \"OAUTH_TOKEN\" }); In a browser using RequireJS \u2301 define(['octokat'], function(Octokat) { var octo = new Octokat({ username: \"YOU_USER\", password: \"YOUR_PASSWORD\" }); }); In Node.js \u2301 Install instructions: npm install octokat --save var Octokat = require('octokat'); var octo = new Octokat({ username: \"YOU_USER\", password: \"YOUR_PASSWORD\" }); var cb = function (err, val) { console.log(val); }; octo.zen.read(cb); octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch(cb); // Fetch repo info octo.me.starred('philschatz', 'octokat.js').add(cb); // Star a repo Using Generators in Node.js 0.11 (or EcmaScript 6 browsers) \u2301 This requires Node.js 0.11 with the --harmony-generators flag: var co = require('co'); var Octokat = require('octokat'); var octo = new Octokat(); var fn = function *() { var zen = yield octo.zen.read(); var info = yield octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch(); console.log(zen); console.log(info); }; co(fn)(); Using bower \u2301 This file can be included using the bower package manager: bower install octokat --save Setup \u2301 This is all you need to get up and running: <script src=\"../dist/octokat.js\"></script> <script> var octo = new Octokat(); octo.zen.read(function(err, message) { if (err) { throw new Error(err); } alert(message); }); </script> Promises (Optional) \u2301 octokat.js has the following optional dependencies when used in a browser: A Promise API (supports jQuery, AngularJS, or a Promise polyfill) If you are already using jQuery or AngularJS in your project just be sure to include them before Octokat and it will use their Promise API. Otherwise, you can include a Promise polyfill like jakearchibald/es6-promise : <script src=\"./node_modules/es6-promise/dist/promise-0.1.2.js\"></script> <script src=\"./octokat.js\"> Preview new APIs \u2301 To use the APIs available for preview just add a acceptHeader when instantiating Octokat. For example: var octo = new Octokat({ token: 'API_TOKEN' acceptHeader: 'application/vnd.github.cannonball-preview+json' }); Enterprise APIs \u2301 To use the Enterprise APIs add the root URL when instantiating Octokat: var octo = new Octokat({ token: 'API_TOKEN' rootUrl: 'https://example.com/api/v3/' }); Testing \u2301 npm test will run the mocha tests for Node.js and the browser. Additionally, they can be run in the browser by starting a web server and going to ./test/index.html . About the Library \u2301 Overview \u2301 This library closely mirrors the https://developer.github.com/v3 documentation. For example, GET /repos/:owner/:repo becomes octo.repos(owner, repo).fetch() and POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/comments becomes octo.repos(owner, repo).issues(number).comments.create(params) . Promises and Callbacks \u2301 This library supports Node.js-style callbacks as well as Promises. To use a callback, just specify it as the last argument to a method. To use a Promise, do not specify a callback and the return value will be a Promise. Example (get information on a repo): # Using callbacks octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch (err, repo) -> console.error(err) if err # Do fancy stuff... # Using Promises octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch() .then (repo) -> # Do fancy stuff .then null, (err) -> console.error(err) Chaining \u2301 You construct the URL by chaining properties and methods together and an async call is made once a verb method is called (see below). Example: octo = new Octokat() repo = octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js') # Check if the current user is a collaborator on a repo repo.collaborators.contains(USER) .then (isCollaborator) -> # If not, then star the Repo unless isCollaborator repo.star.add() .then () -> # Done! Or, update a specific comment: octo = new Octokat(token: ...) octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').issues(1).comments(123123).update(body: 'Hello') .then () -> # Done! The basic structure of these methods is: .foos.fetch({optionalStuff:...}) yields a list of items (possibly paginated) .foos(id).fetch(...) yields a single item (issue, repo, user) .foos.contains(id) tests membership in a list (yields true/false) .foos.create(...) creates a new foo .foos(id).add() adds an existing User/Repo to the list .foos(id).remove() removes a member from a list or deletes the object and yields a boolean indicating success JSON with methods (Hypermedia) \u2301 GitHub provides URL patterns in its JSON responses. These are automatically converted into methods. For example: octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').fetch() .then (repo) -> # GitHub returns a JSON which contains something like compare_url: 'https://..../compare/{head}...{base} # This is converted to a method that accepts 2 arguments repo.compare(sha1, sha2).fetch() .then (comparison) -> # Done! Paged Results \u2301 If a .fetch() returns paged results then nextPage() , previousPage() , firstPage() and lastPage() are added to the returned JSON. For example: octo.repos('philschatz', 'octokat.js').commits.fetch() .then (someCommits) -> someCommits.nextPage() .then (moreCommits) -> # Done! Development \u2301 Run npm install Run grunt dist to generate the files in the ./dist directory The unit tests are named to illustrate examples of using the API. See Travis tests or run npm test to see them. linkedin/sepia is used to generate recorded results from GitHub and philschatz/sepia.js uses them in the browser.
